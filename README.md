# Pirate Intelligent Agent (CS 370)

## Overview
This repository contains my Project Two submission for CS 370: Current and Emerging Trends in Computer Science. The project demonstrates the use of reinforcement learning and neural networks to train an intelligent agent to solve a pathfinding problem in a maze environment.

The pirate agent learns how to navigate the maze and reach a treasure by interacting with the environment and learning from rewards rather than following hard‑coded rules.

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to design and train a pirate non‑player character that can successfully reach a treasure located within a maze. Using deep Q‑learning, the agent improves its performance over time by balancing exploration and exploitation.

The project was implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and demonstrates key artificial intelligence concepts such as experience replay, reward‑based learning, and policy optimization.

## What I Worked On
- Implemented the Q‑training algorithm inside the provided Jupyter Notebook
- Designed the exploration and exploitation logic using an epsilon‑greedy strategy
- Stored and replayed experiences to train the neural network
- Updated the target network to stabilize learning
- Evaluated performance using win rate and a completion check

The environment, maze structure, and helper classes were provided as part of the starter code. The training logic and learning behavior were implemented by me.

## Technologies Used

  Project overview and reflection

## Reflection
This project helped reinforce how intelligent agents learn through interaction rather than predefined instructions. It also highlighted the importance of careful reward design, ethical responsibility, and keeping humans involved in decision‑making systems.

The experience gained from this project connects directly to real‑world applications such as robotics, automation, and decision‑support systems.

## Ethical Considerations
When designing intelligent systems, it is important to consider transparency, reliability, and user trust. This project emphasizes the importance of keeping humans in the loop and ensuring that AI systems support decision‑making rather than replace it.
